🧠 1. PSYCHOLOGICAL & COPY OPTIMIZATION

Make it emotionally sticky while keeping clarity.

Section	Current	Elevated Version (Replace Texts Exactly)	Why it Works
Hero Line	“Clarity today. Career wins all year.”	“Find your direction in minutes. Stay ahead all year.”	Keeps rhythm but adds instant-action tone.
Subtext	“India’s first AI-guided career platform for Agri students...”	“Built for Agri students who want clarity, speed, and results — not confusion. Your AI mentor is ready.”	Creates trust through contrast (“not confusion”).
CTA Button	“Take Free Career Quiz”	“Get My Career Plan →”	Shifts from generic CTA to personalized ownership.
Mid-banner (“Ready to discover…”)	“Take the free AI-guided Career Quiz…”	“5 minutes. 1 quiz. A personalized roadmap to your best-fit career.”	Adds precision + reward perception.
Testimonials	Keep names; change tone	“TAV didn’t just tell me my path — it showed me how to reach it.” — Ananya, ABM	Emotional + action-oriented.
Plans Header	“Learn by doing”	“Turn study into strategy.”	Adds strategic identity.
Ultra Plan	“Weekly upskilling classes, AI assistant”	“Your AI-powered finishing school — polish every week, grow every month.”	Creates premium feel.
