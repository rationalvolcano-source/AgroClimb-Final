🔧 Build Prompt — Plan B · Excel · Sprint 1 (Intro)

Goal: Create sprint1.html (single file; inline CSS + JS; no frameworks) that implements:

Learn section with one YouTube lite embed placeholder (click-to-play)

Practice section: sandbox grid (editable table) + 3 tasks + 8-minute timer + Farmer Kiran AI-style hints when a task fails

Reflect section: success summary + quick tips + navigation to Sprint 2

Store progress in localStorage.sprint1

0) Constraints & Targets

Theme: dark-teal (bg #0b1420, accent #26A69A, mint #14B8A6, border #1e2b3f, text near-white).

No external JS libraries. You may embed one custom element for the lite YouTube.

Performance: initial HTML+CSS+JS ≤ ~50 KB; LCP < 2s on 4G; only load iframe when user clicks play; no network calls for sandbox.

Accessibility: keyboard usable, focus outlines, sufficient contrast, semantic landmarks.

Mobile-first responsive layout; max content width ~1100px.

1) File output

Create a single file:

sprint1.html (contains all HTML, CSS, and JS inline).

2) Page structure

Use this three-section layout:

Header card with title (“Excel S1 — Introduction to Excel”) and small pill “~20 min · Learn → Practice → Reflect”.

Grid with two cards side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile:

Left card: Learn (the video placeholder + “Start Practice” button).

Right card: Practice (timer, tasks, editable grid, Farmer Kiran bubble, action buttons).

Reflect card (hidden until success or after pressing Check), with summary + chip tips + buttons (“Continue to Sprint 2”, “Review Practice”).

3) Learn section (YouTube lite embed)

Implement a custom Web Component <lite-yt data-id="VIDEO_ID_PLACEHOLDER">:

Renders a poster (SVG or AVIF placeholder) and a Play button.

On click, replaces itself with a real <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID_PLACEHOLDER?autoplay=1">.

Use loading="lazy" on the <iframe>.

Below the player, add two buttons: Start Practice ▶ (starts timer) and Skip video (also starts timer).

Acceptance: No YouTube network requests until the user clicks Play.

4) Practice section (sandbox grid + tasks)

Use a plain HTML <table> as the grid; no libraries.

Make cells contenteditable except the Total ₹ column (computed).

Provide seed data (≤ 1 KB) to render on load:

const seed = [
  ["Aarav","Tomato","1200","12",""],
  ["Meera","Potato","850","16","2025-01-03"],
  ["Ishita","Onion","1,000","18",""],
  ["Vikram","Chilli","500","22",""]
];


Show an 8-minute countdown with a progress bar (scaleX transform).

Show a checklist of 3 tasks (each becomes ✓ when validated):

Enter at least 5 rows of data (Name, Crop, Qty, Price, Date) — no blanks in the first 5 rows across those columns.

Format Qty as Number → (validation rule: the Qty column must be purely numeric without commas or text).

Add “Total ₹” = Qty × Price for all rows (rounded to 2 decimals); Total column is computed automatically during validation but users may also type; validator will overwrite with computed value.

Buttons: Check My Work, + Add Row, Reset.

Add a Farmer Kiran bubble (text only) that appears on failure with a contextual nudge and a visual highlight of the problem cells (e.g., outline Qty column in yellow for 1–2 seconds).

Validation logic (JS functions required):

t1_noBlanks(rows) — ensure at least 5 rows; first 5 rows have non-blank cells in columns 0..4.

t2_qtyNumeric(rows) — Qty values must match /^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$/; commas or letters fail.

t3_totalComputed(rows) — for each row with numeric Qty & Price, Total equals Qty*Price within 0.01.

evaluate() should:

Recompute Total for rows with valid numbers, write values into the table (two decimals).

Run all three task checks; mark checklist items done/undone.

If all pass → stop timer, save to localStorage.sprint1, and reveal Reflect card with success summary.

If any fail → show Farmer Kiran bubble with a short tip and highlight offending cells/column.

Timer behavior:

Start when user clicks Start Practice or Skip video.

On expiry, show nudge: “Time is up — let’s fix the quickest task first,” keep the table intact for retry.

Persistence:

On pass, save:

localStorage.setItem('sprint1', JSON.stringify({
  passed: true,
  time: elapsedSeconds,
  attempts: attemptCount,
  completedAt: new Date().toISOString()
}));

5) Reflect section (summary + tips)

When evaluate() passes all tasks:

Show a summary: “You completed 3/3 tasks in mm:ss.”

Show chip tips (static): “Ctrl+S often”, “Double-click Fill Handle”, “Use Wrap Text”, “Avoid commas in numbers”.

Buttons: Continue to Sprint 2 ▶ (link sprint2.html) and Review Practice (scroll back up and hide Reflect).

6) Styling & UX

Cards: rounded 18px, border #1e2b3f, soft shadow; background #101a28.

Primary buttons: gradient teal (#26A69A → #14B8A6), bold text, 12px radius.

Table: sticky header row, row separators, focus background on active cell.

Farmer Kiran bubble: small muted message with a pointer triangle; appears only on failure, disappears on reset or success.

Animations: small fade/translate only (fast, GPU-friendly).

Keyboard accessibility: Enter to trigger focused button; tab order logical.

7) JavaScript outline (must implement)

Lite YouTube component:

customElements.define('lite-yt', class extends HTMLElement{
  connectedCallback(){
    this.querySelector('button')?.addEventListener('click', ()=>{
      const id=this.dataset.id||'';
      this.innerHTML = `<iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/${id}?autoplay=1"
        title="YouTube video" frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen></iframe>`;
    }, {once:true});
  }
});


Grid helpers: render(rows), read(), addRow(), reset(); compute totals on the fly in evaluate().

Timer: startTimer(), fmt(seconds), progress bar scaleX from 1 → 0.

Validation functions named exactly: t1_noBlanks, t2_qtyNumeric, t3_totalComputed; evaluate() orchestrates them.

Farmer Kiran:

DOM id: kiran (container) and kiranText (message).

Example nudges to use:

Qty issue: “Remove commas from Qty; try typing 1200 instead of 1,200.”

Total issue: “Select the first Total cell, then double-click the fill handle to copy down.”

Missing rows: “Add rows until you have 5 complete records (Name..Date).”

8) Acceptance criteria (Replit should verify all)

✅ Single file sprint1.html with inline CSS+JS, no external JS frameworks.

✅ YouTube area shows poster + Play button, only loads iframe on click.

✅ Editable table renders from seed data; + Add Row works.

✅ 8-minute timer starts on “Start Practice” or “Skip video”; displays mm:ss and progress bar.

✅ Check My Work validates three tasks; checklist reflects pass/fail; failure shows Farmer Kiran hint and highlights.

✅ On pass, Reflect card appears with completion time and tips; Continue to Sprint 2 navigates to sprint2.html.

✅ Progress stored under localStorage.sprint1.

✅ Fully responsive, accessible focus states, contrasts, and small GPU-friendly animations.

✅ Initial load remains fast (no iframe/network for video until clicked; no CDN dependencies).

9) Optional improvements (comment in code, don’t implement heavy libs)

Add prefers-reduced-motion CSS to reduce animations.

Provide a “Reset & Try Again” that also clears kiran bubble.

Preload first 10 rows as placeholders for smoother typing
