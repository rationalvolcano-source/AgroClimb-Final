You are building a single-file HTML/CSS/JS game called Flashcard Duel — a fast, addictive quiz duel with AI opponent, 3 modes (Easy / Difficult / Legendary), and TheAgriVision teal theme.

0️⃣ Output

One self-contained file: index.html

Inline CSS and JS only (no frameworks or CDN links).

Must run directly on Replit (HTML template Repl).

1️⃣ Theme — TheAgriVision Palette

Use this teal-dark theme:

:root {
  --bg:#0b1420;
  --card:#101a28;
  --acc:#26A69A;
  --acc2:#14B8A6;
  --text:#eef4f8;
  --muted:#9fb2c3;
  --good:#22c55e;
  --bad:#ef4444;
  --warn:#f59e0b;
}


Background: radial gradient from navy to deep teal.

Buttons: gradient from var(--acc) → var(--acc2).

Fonts: Inter, system-ui; clean and modern.

2️⃣ Gameplay Flow (with PDF upload requirement)
Before any game starts:

Player must upload a PDF file containing question data.

The PDF should contain questions and four options per question, formatted like this:

Q1. Which vitamin is abundant in carrots?
A) Vitamin A (C)
B) Vitamin C
C) Vitamin D
D) Vitamin K


Exactly one option has “(C)” — that marks the correct answer.

The app must parse this PDF, extract all questions, options, and correct answers.

Use any PDF text extraction approach available in vanilla JS (e.g., pdf.js or browser FileReader + regex parsing of plain text).

Store the parsed data into an internal JSON array with fields:

{ question: "Which vitamin is abundant in carrots?",
  options: ["Vitamin A","Vitamin C","Vitamin D","Vitamin K"],
  correct_answer: "Vitamin A" }


Show popup → “✅ Questions Loaded: X found”.

3️⃣ Modes & Round Config
Mode	Time per Q	Total Rounds	AI Base Accuracy
Easy	14 sec	10	0.55
Difficult	10 sec	12	0.70
Legendary	7 sec	14	0.85
4️⃣ Duel Mechanics

Player and AI both answer each round.

Player selects one option → color feedback:

Correct: green glow & +12 points

Wrong: red shake animation & streak reset

AI answers mid-timer using probabilistic accuracy above.

AI gets +10 for correct, +0 for wrong.

Timeout = player auto-wrong, AI +3.

Combo every 3 corrects → popup “🔥 Combo x3” with +25 XP & meter fill.

5️⃣ UI Layout

Header: Title ⚡ Flashcard Duel, File Upload button (“📥 Upload PDF”), Mode dropdown, “▶ Start Duel” button.

Left Card:
